# PB Livin' Runner (pblivin-runner)

[PB Livin' Runner (pblivin-runner)](https://pblivin0x.github.io/pblivin-runner/) is a fork of the classic [trex runner game (t-rex-runner)](https://wayou.github.io/t-rex-runner/), in which a young developer (PB Livin') must dodge angry Waluigi and other obstacles. 

## Graphic Design 

Special shoutout to my friend [Nikki Mantis](https://www.nikkimantis.com/), who helped me with the graphic design. She is a pleasure to work with and does take on commissioned work!
